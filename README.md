Getting started

Hey all,
 been recently starting to get a lot more interested in coding. been doing tutorials through the codeacademy website and been following a few youtubers and made my first "website" using sublime text. im interested in learning as much as i can to possibly make a career change! ive always been interested in this but finally making the push!
